# SUPER BASIC CSS PIXEL GRID

This pixel grid, essentially made out of one class called `.pixel-grid`, wich i put into a div frame for its centered prosition to show some fun things you can do with pure HTML5/CSS3.

The width and height of the frame determines the amount of pixels on screen:
If every pixel dot is 10x10px, and the frame is width: 120x160px, the visible area is 12x16 pixels.
